# Triplicator

This is a Visual Studio C++ app made to solve a problem that I shall dub "Triplicator."

This problem stems from the most recent "Ted-Ed Riddle," created by Dan Finkel.

## Premise ##

An unknown machine generates an integer output based on an integer input.

The outputs of the machine are not bound to any rules except the following:

* The machine will only accept inputs that are positive integers, and will only ever output positive integers.
* The machine's output is always greater than the input it receives.
* The machine will always generate a constant and unique output for every input.
  * no two inputs will generate the same output
  * each input will always generate the same output; no influence from previous inputs or other factors
* Taking the output from the machine and using it as input will always yield three times the original input.

The goal of the original Ted-Ed riddle is to deduce the machine's output when it is inputted with the number 13.
However, the video does not detail more about any emerging patterns when the sequence continues.
This program is made to solve this.

## Solution ##

This is a Visual Studio console app written in C++. The purpose of this project is to challenge its developer (myself )to use object-oriented programming and a difficult language to improve their skills.

The goal of this project exists only to give the project a meaningful direction; yet the main focus remains on C++ skillbuilding.
While some of the mechanics in this project *may* already exist through libraries, using them would contradict the purpose of this project.

## Features ##

* Input is accepted command-line style, with keywords for a command followed by parameters.
  * After learning about 

## Usage ##
